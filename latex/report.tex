\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a scalable, modular CV-Job Matching System designed to address the challenges of unstructured resume parsing and semantic job matching. We propose a hybrid retrieval approach combining dense vector embeddings with BM25 keyword search, enhanced by a cross-encoder reranking stage. Our system achieves high accuracy in parsing using a robust LLM-based pipeline and provides explainable match recommendations. We evaluate our system using nDCG, MRR, and schema accuracy metrics, demonstrating significant improvements over baseline methods.

\section{Introduction}
The recruitment process is often bottlenecked by the manual review of resumes. Automated systems face challenges in accurately parsing diverse PDF layouts and matching candidates based on semantic meaning rather than just keywords.
